Imagine a planet orbiting a star with mass \\( M \\) in a circle. The orbital radius is \\( r \\) , and the orbital period is \\( T \\) , the time for one full trip around. Two forces are at play: gravity pulls the planet toward the star, and the planet\u2019s circular motion needs a force to keep it from flying off. Gravity provides that force. Gravity\u2019s strength is: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] where \\( m \\) is the planet\u2019s mass and \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant. For circular motion, the centripetal force depends on speed \\( v \\) and radius \\( r \\) : \\[ F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Since gravity is the centripetal force, they\u2019re equal: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Cancel \\( m \\) (it\u2019s not zero) and simplify: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\( r \\) : \\[ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Now, the speed \\( v \\) is how fast the planet moves around the circle. One orbit\u2019s distance is the circumference, \\( 2\\pi r \\) , and it takes time \\( T \\) , so: \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Square it: \\[ v^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} \\] Set the two expressions for \\( v^2 \\) equal: \\[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\( T^2 \\) and divide by \\( \\frac{G M}{r} \\) (or cross-multiply): \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\cdot T^2 \\] Multiply both sides by \\( r \\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2 \\] Divide by \\( G M \\) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] That\u2019s it! \\( T^2 \\) (the period squared) is proportional to \\( r^3 \\) (the radius cubed), with \\( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\) as the constant. This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law, simplified: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] TASK 2 Let\u2019s discuss the implications of Kepler\u2019s Third Law\u2014the relationship where the square of the orbital period ( \\( T^2 \\) ) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ( \\( r^3 \\) )\u2014for astronomy, focusing on how it helps calculate planetary masses and distances. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward. Implications for Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law, \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) , connects a planet\u2019s orbit to the mass of the object it orbits (like a star or planet) and the distance between them. This is a big deal because it lets astronomers figure out things about space without needing to visit planets or stars. It\u2019s like a cosmic ruler and scale rolled into one. 1. Calculating Planetary Masses If something (like a moon or satellite) orbits a planet, we can use the law to find the planet\u2019s mass. Here\u2019s how: - Measure the orbital period \\( T \\) (how long one orbit takes) and the radius \\( r \\) (distance from the planet\u2019s center). - Plug those into the equation: \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) . - Rearrange to solve for \\( M \\) (the planet\u2019s mass): \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\) . - Since \\( G \\) is a known constant ( \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) ), and we can observe \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) , we calculate \\( M \\) . For example, Earth\u2019s moon orbits in about 27.3 days ( \\( T \\) ) at a distance of roughly 384,000 km ( \\( r \\) ). Using these, astronomers calculated Earth\u2019s mass long ago. The same trick works for any planet with a moon or for the Sun with planets orbiting it. 2. Measuring Distances If we know the mass of the central body (like the Sun), we can flip the law to find distances: - Measure \\( T \\) (say, a planet\u2019s year). - Use the Sun\u2019s known mass ( \\( M \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) and solve for \\( r \\) : \\( r^3 = \\frac{G M T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\) , then take the cube root. - This gives the average distance from the Sun to the planet. For instance, if we know Mars takes 687 days to orbit the Sun, we can compute its distance from the Sun using the Sun\u2019s mass. This helped map our solar system before telescopes got super precise. 3. Broader Impact Solar System Design : The law shows why inner planets (like Mercury) orbit fast and outer ones (like Neptune) take longer\u2014bigger \\( r \\) means bigger \\( T \\) . Exoplanets : Astronomers spot planets around other stars by watching how long they take to orbit ( \\( T \\) ) and estimating their distance ( \\( r \\) ), then guessing the star\u2019s mass. Satellites : We use it to place satellites at the right distance from Earth for specific orbit times, like 24 hours for GPS satellites. Simple Takeaway Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a tool that turns time and distance into mass and vice versa. Watch how long something orbits and how far it is, and you can weigh a planet or measure its distance from a star. It\u2019s a simple rule that unlocks the scale of the universe! TASK 3 Let\u2019s analyze real-world examples of Kepler\u2019s Third Law ( \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) ) using the Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth and the orbits of planets in the Solar System. I\u2019ll keep it simple and based on the given information about orbital period and radius. 1. The Moon\u2019s Orbit Around Earth The Moon orbits Earth, so Earth\u2019s mass ( \\( M \\) ) is the central mass in the equation. We can use Kepler\u2019s Third Law to check how the Moon\u2019s orbital period and radius fit together. Orbital Period ( \\( T \\) ) : The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth. Convert that to seconds for consistency: \\( T = 27.3 \\, \\text{days} \\times 86,400 \\, \\text{s/day} \\approx 2.36 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{seconds} \\) . Orbital Radius ( \\( r \\) ) : The average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 384,000 km, or \\( r = 3.84 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{meters} \\) . Earth\u2019s Mass ( \\( M \\) ) : Known to be about \\( 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\) . Gravitational Constant ( \\( G \\) ) : \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) . 2. Planets in the Solar System Now let\u2019s look at planets orbiting the Sun, with the Sun\u2019s mass ( \\( M \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) as the central mass. We\u2019ll test Earth and Mars. Simple Solution Kepler\u2019s Third Law works in the real world. For the Moon, its 27.3-day orbit at 384,000 km fits Earth\u2019s mass. For planets like Earth (1 year, 1 AU) and Mars (687 days, 1.524 AU), their orbits match the Sun\u2019s mass. The law ties \\( T^2 \\) to \\( r^3 \\) , letting us predict and check how things move in space. It\u2019s a simple rule that fits the Moon and planets perfectly! TASK 4 Let\u2019s implement a simple computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law ( \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) ), based on the given information about orbital period and radius. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward, using a basic approach you could code in something like Python, and focus on verifying the relationship. Simple Computational Model We\u2019ll simulate a planet orbiting a star (like the Sun) in a circular orbit. The idea is to calculate the orbital period ( \\( T \\) ) for a given radius ( \\( r \\) ) and mass ( \\( M \\) ), then check if \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) holds. Here\u2019s how to do it simply: Step 1: Set Up the System Central Mass ( \\( M \\) ) : Use the Sun\u2019s mass, \\( M = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) . Gravitational Constant ( \\( G \\) ) : \\( G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) . Orbital Radii ( \\( r \\) ) : Pick a few distances, like 1 AU, 2 AU, and 3 AU (1 AU = \\( 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} \\) ). Step 2: Calculate Orbital Speed For a circular orbit, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force. The orbital speed ( \\( v \\) ) is: [ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} ] We\u2019ll compute this for each radius. Step 3: Compute Orbital Period The period ( \\( T \\) ) is the time to travel the circumference ( \\( 2\\pi r \\) ) at speed \\( v \\) : [ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}} ] Simplify: [ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} ] This matches Kepler\u2019s Third Law when squared: \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) . Step 4: Conclusion The model calculates \\( T \\) from \\( r \\) and \\( M \\) , and when we square \\( T \\) and compare it to \\( r^3 \\) , the relationship \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) holds every time. The constant \\( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\) stays the same for the Sun\u2019s mass, proving the law works. Simple Solution This model picks distances (like 1 AU, 2 AU, 3 AU), finds the speed and period using gravity, and checks that \\( T^2 \\) matches \\( r^3 \\) times a constant. For the Sun, 1 AU gives 1 year, 2 AU gives about 2.83 years, and 3 AU gives about 5.2 years\u2014Kepler\u2019s Third Law is spot on every time! Deliverables A detailed explanation of the subjects Orbital Period, Radius, and Kepler\u2019s Third Law Orbital Period The orbital period ( \\( T \\) ) is the time an object takes to complete one full orbit around another body. - Example : Earth orbits the Sun in 1 year (365.25 days), and the Moon orbits Earth in 27.3 days . Orbital Radius The orbital radius ( \\( r \\) ) is the distance between the center of the orbiting object and the body it orbits. - Example : Earth\u2019s orbital radius around the Sun is 1 AU (1.496 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 m) . Kepler\u2019s Third Law Kepler\u2019s Third Law states: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This means that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the radius . In other words: - Larger orbits take longer \u2014if you double the radius, the period increases by about 2.83 times . - The relationship is based on gravity balancing motion. Why It Matters Kepler\u2019s Law helps us: - Predict planetary motion. - Measure masses of celestial bodies. - Understand why inner planets orbit faster than outer ones.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#task-1","text":"Let\u2019s derive Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits in a simpler way, focusing on the key ideas with less algebra.

First Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to orbit a celestial body (like Earth) without falling back down. Physical Meaning: This is the speed required to become a satellite. For Earth, it\u2019s about 7.9 km/s (around 28,000 km/h). At this speed, the object moves fast enough that its curved path matches the curve of the planet, keeping it in a stable orbit instead of crashing back due to gravity. Second Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to completely escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational pull and leave it behind. Physical Meaning: This is the escape velocity. For Earth, it\u2019s about 11.2 km/s (around 40,000 km/h). At this speed, the object has enough energy to break free from the planet\u2019s gravity and head into space, no longer bound to orbit or return. Third Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (like the Sun) and leave it entirely, starting from a planet within that system. Physical Meaning: This is about leaving the solar system. For an object starting from Earth, it\u2019s around 16.6 km/s (relative to Earth) when accounting for Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun. It means the object overcomes both the planet\u2019s and the star\u2019s gravity to travel into interstellar space. In short: First = orbit the planet. Second = escape the planet.

Elliptical Trajectory: If the payload is released with a speed less than the \"escape speed\" (about 11.2 km/s near Earth) but enough to stay in orbit, it will follow an elliptical path. This means it loops around Earth in an oval shape, like a satellite. Example: A payload dropped from a rocket in low Earth orbit with a gentle push might circle Earth in an ellipse. Parabolic Trajectory: If the payload is released with exactly the escape speed (11.2 km/s), it follows a parabolic path. It moves away from Earth and just barely escapes gravity, slowing down as it goes but never returning. Example: A payload given a precise kick to hit this speed would trace a curve that flattens out as it leaves Earth. Hyperbolic Trajectory: If the payload is released with a speed greater than the escape speed, it follows a hyperbolic path. It escapes Earth\u2019s gravity entirely and keeps going into space, moving faster than needed to break free. Example: A payload launched with a strong boost (say, 15 km/s) would zip away from Earth in a wide, open curve. Simple Breakdown: Speed < Escape Speed: Elliptical (loops around Earth). Speed = Escape Speed: Parabolic (escapes but just barely). Speed > Escape Speed: Hyperbolic (escapes easily). TASK2 Perform a numerical analysis to compute the path of the payload based on given initial conditions (position, velocity, and altitude). Initial Conditions (Example): Altitude : 400 km above Earth\u2019s surface (like a low Earth orbit). Position : Starting at (x, y) = (6778 km, 0 km), where Earth\u2019s radius is ~6378 km, so total distance from Earth\u2019s center is 6778 km. Velocity : 7.5 km/s horizontally (a bit below escape speed, close to orbital speed). Earth\u2019s Gravity : ~9.8 m/s\u00b2 at the surface, but weaker at altitude (we\u2019ll simplify it). Simple Numerical Approach: We\u2019ll track the payload\u2019s path step-by-step over time, using small time steps (e.g., 1 second). Gravity pulls it toward Earth\u2019s center, and its initial velocity keeps it moving. Here\u2019s how it works: Gravity at Altitude : Gravity decreases with distance from Earth\u2019s center. At 6778 km, it\u2019s roughly 8.7 m/s\u00b2 (a simple approximation: 9.8 \u00d7 (6378/6778)\u00b2). It pulls straight toward (0, 0), Earth\u2019s center. Step-by-Step Path : Start: Position = (6778 km, 0 km), Velocity = (0 km/s, 7.5 km/s) (horizontal). Each second: Update velocity: Gravity pulls downward (x-direction here), so x-velocity changes by -8.7 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 1 s = -0.0087 km/s. Update position: Move based on current velocity (e.g., x_new = x_old + vx \u00d7 time). Example Calculation (First Few Steps) : Time = 0 s : Position: (6778, 0) Velocity: (0, 7.5) Time = 1 s : Gravity adjusts velocity: vx = 0 - 0.0087 = -0.0087 km/s, vy = 7.5 km/s. New position: x = 6778 - 0.0087 \u00d7 1 = 6777.9913 km, y = 0 + 7.5 \u00d7 1 = 7.5 km. Time = 2 s : Velocity: vx = -0.0087 - 0.0087 = -0.0174 km/s, vy = 7.5 km/s. Position: x = 6777.9913 - 0.0174 \u00d7 1 = 6777.9739 km, y = 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 km. Trajectory Shape : Over time, the payload curves downward while moving sideways. After many steps (e.g., 1000 seconds), it loops around Earth in an ellipse because the speed (7.5 km/s) is less than escape speed (11.2 km/s) but enough for orbit at this altitude. Distance from Earth\u2019s center stays roughly constant (near 6778 km), confirming an elliptical path. Simple Result: With these conditions (400 km altitude, 7.5 km/s horizontal velocity), the payload follows an elliptical trajectory , orbiting Earth in an oval shape. It doesn\u2019t escape or crash right away\u2014it circles Earth, gradually curving due to gravity. # TASK3 Discuss how these trajectories relate to orbital insertion, reentry, or escape scenarios. Orbital Insertion: What It Means: Getting the payload to stay in orbit around Earth, circling it over and over. Trajectory Link: This happens with an elliptical path. If the payload is released at a good height (like 400 km) with enough sideways speed (like 7.5 km/s in our example), it loops around Earth without falling or flying off. How It Works: The sideways speed keeps it from crashing down, and gravity keeps it from drifting away. Our example payload, moving at 7.5 km/s at 6778 km from Earth\u2019s center, settles into an oval orbit\u2014perfect for satellites or space stations. Reentry: What It Means: The payload falls back to Earth, usually burning up or landing. Trajectory Link: This ties to an elliptical path that gets too close to Earth. If the speed is too low (say, 5 km/s instead of 7.5 km/s) or it\u2019s released lower down, gravity pulls it in faster than it can circle. The ellipse shrinks until it hits the atmosphere. How It Works: In our example, if we slowed the payload or aimed it slightly downward, it\u2019d curve back toward Earth instead of orbiting fully. Think of a capsule dropping from orbit\u2014it follows a tight curve and lands. Escape: What It Means: The payload leaves Earth completely, heading into space. Trajectory Link: This matches a parabolic or hyperbolic path. At exactly 11.2 km/s (escape speed), it\u2019s parabolic\u2014just enough to break free. Faster than that (like 12 km/s), it\u2019s hyperbolic, zooming off easily. How It Works: If our payload got a big boost to 12 km/s instead of 7.5 km/s, it\u2019d sail away from Earth, never looping back. This is how probes leave for the Moon or beyond. Simple Summary: Elliptical: Stays in orbit (orbital insertion) or falls back if too slow/low (reentry). Parabolic: Just escapes, barely breaking free (escape). Hyperbolic: Flies off fast (escape). # TASK4 Develop a computational tool to simulate and visualize the motion of the payload under Earth's gravity, accounting for initial velocities and directions. # step-by-step simulator that: Tracks the payload\u2019s position and velocity over time. Shows how it moves under Earth\u2019s gravity (pulling toward the center). Lets you set the starting speed, direction, and height. Visualizes the path (like a line curving around Earth). Set Up the Basics: Earth is a point at (0, 0). Payload starts at some distance (e.g., 6778 km, or 400 km above Earth\u2019s 6378 km radius). You pick the initial speed (e.g., 7.5 km/s) and direction (e.g., sideways, up, or angled). Gravity pulls toward (0, 0), weaker the farther out (about 8.7 m/s\u00b2 at 400 km). Move It Step-by-Step: Time ticks in small steps (like 1 second). Each step: Gravity tugs the payload toward Earth a tiny bit (changes velocity). Payload moves based on its current speed and direction. Keep going for, say, 1000 steps to see the full path. Example Starting Point: Position: (6778 km, 0 km) \u2014 400 km up. Velocity: 7.5 km/s sideways (so 0 km/s down, 7.5 km/s right). Each second: Gravity pulls down a little (e.g., slows \u201cdown\u201d speed by 0.0087 km/s). Moves to a new spot (e.g., down a bit, right a lot). Visualize It: Draw Earth as a circle (radius 6378 km). Plot the payload\u2019s position each step as a dot. Connect the dots to see the path (e.g., an oval for orbit, a curve flying off for escape).","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#problem-3","text":"# # TASK1 Analyze the possible trajectories (e.g., parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptical) of a payload released near Earth.","title":"Problem 3"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#elliptical-trajectory","text":"If the payload is released with a speed less than the \"escape speed\" (about 11.2 km/s near Earth) but enough to stay in orbit, it will follow an elliptical path.

Velocity : 7.5 km/s horizontally (a bit below escape speed, close to orbital speed). Earth\u2019s Gravity : ~9.8 m/s\u00b2 at the surface, but weaker at altitude (we\u2019ll simplify it).","title":"Initial Conditions (Example):"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#simple-numerical-approach","text":"We\u2019ll track the payload\u2019s path step-by-step over time, using small time steps (e.g., 1 second). Gravity pulls it toward Earth\u2019s center, and its initial velocity keeps it moving. Here\u2019s how it works: Gravity at Altitude : Gravity decreases with distance from Earth\u2019s center. At 6778 km, it\u2019s roughly 8.7 m/s\u00b2 (a simple approximation: 9.8 \u00d7 (6378/6778)\u00b2). It pulls straight toward (0, 0), Earth\u2019s center. Step-by-Step Path : Start: Position = (6778 km, 0 km), Velocity = (0 km/s, 7.5 km/s) (horizontal). Each second: Update velocity: Gravity pulls downward (x-direction here), so x-velocity changes by -8.7 m/s\u00b2 \u00d7 1 s = -0.0087 km/s. Update position: Move based on current velocity (e.g., x_new = x_old + vx \u00d7 time). Example Calculation (First Few Steps) : Time = 0 s : Position: (6778, 0) Velocity: (0, 7.5) Time = 1 s : Gravity adjusts velocity: vx = 0 - 0.0087 = -0.0087 km/s, vy = 7.5 km/s. New position: x = 6778 - 0.0087 \u00d7 1 = 6777.9913 km, y = 0 + 7.5 \u00d7 1 = 7.5 km. Time = 2 s : Velocity: vx = -0.0087 - 0.0087 = -0.0174 km/s, vy = 7.5 km/s. Position: x = 6777.9913 - 0.0174 \u00d7 1 = 6777.9739 km, y = 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 km. Trajectory Shape : Over time, the payload curves downward while moving sideways. After many steps (e.g., 1000 seconds), it loops around Earth in an ellipse because the speed (7.5 km/s) is less than escape speed (11.2 km/s) but enough for orbit at this altitude. Distance from Earth\u2019s center stays roughly constant (near 6778 km), confirming an elliptical path.","title":"Simple Numerical Approach:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#simple-result","text":"With these conditions (400 km altitude, 7.5 km/s horizontal velocity), the payload follows an elliptical trajectory , orbiting Earth in an oval shape.

Trajectory Link: This happens with an elliptical path. If the payload is released at a good height (like 400 km) with enough sideways speed (like 7.5 km/s in our example), it loops around Earth without falling or flying off. How It Works: The sideways speed keeps it from crashing down, and gravity keeps it from drifting away. Our example payload, moving at 7.5 km/s at 6778 km from Earth\u2019s center, settles into an oval orbit\u2014perfect for satellites or space stations.","title":"Orbital Insertion:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#reentry","text":"What It Means: The payload falls back to Earth, usually burning up or landing. Trajectory Link: This ties to an elliptical path that gets too close to Earth. If the speed is too low (say, 5 km/s instead of 7.5 km/s) or it\u2019s released lower down, gravity pulls it in faster than it can circle. The ellipse shrinks until it hits the atmosphere. How It Works: In our example, if we slowed the payload or aimed it slightly downward, it\u2019d curve back toward Earth instead of orbiting fully. Think of a capsule dropping from orbit\u2014it follows a tight curve and lands.","title":"Reentry:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_3/#escape","text":"What It Means: The payload leaves Earth completely, heading into space. Trajectory Link: This matches a parabolic or hyperbolic path. At exactly 11.2 km/s (escape speed), it\u2019s parabolic\u2014just enough to break free. Faster than that (like 12 km/s), it\u2019s hyperbolic, zooming off easily. How It Works: If our payload got a big boost to 12 km/s instead of 7.5 km/s, it\u2019d sail away from Earth, never looping back.
