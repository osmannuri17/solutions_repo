Imagine a planet orbiting a star with mass \\( M \\) in a circle. The orbital radius is \\( r \\) , and the orbital period is \\( T \\) , the time for one full trip around. Two forces are at play: gravity pulls the planet toward the star, and the planet\u2019s circular motion needs a force to keep it from flying off. Gravity provides that force. Gravity\u2019s strength is: \\[ F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\] where \\( m \\) is the planet\u2019s mass and \\( G \\) is the gravitational constant. For circular motion, the centripetal force depends on speed \\( v \\) and radius \\( r \\) : \\[ F_c = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Since gravity is the centripetal force, they\u2019re equal: \\[ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} \\] Cancel \\( m \\) (it\u2019s not zero) and simplify: \\[ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\( r \\) : \\[ v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Now, the speed \\( v \\) is how fast the planet moves around the circle. One orbit\u2019s distance is the circumference, \\( 2\\pi r \\) , and it takes time \\( T \\) , so: \\[ v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T} \\] Square it: \\[ v^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} \\] Set the two expressions for \\( v^2 \\) equal: \\[ \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r} \\] Multiply both sides by \\( T^2 \\) and divide by \\( \\frac{G M}{r} \\) (or cross-multiply): \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^2 = \\frac{G M}{r} \\cdot T^2 \\] Multiply both sides by \\( r \\) : \\[ 4\\pi^2 r^3 = G M T^2 \\] Divide by \\( G M \\) : \\[ T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\] That\u2019s it! \\( T^2 \\) (the period squared) is proportional to \\( r^3 \\) (the radius cubed), with \\( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\) as the constant. This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law, simplified: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] TASK 2 Let\u2019s discuss the implications of Kepler\u2019s Third Law\u2014the relationship where the square of the orbital period ( \\( T^2 \\) ) is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius ( \\( r^3 \\) )\u2014for astronomy, focusing on how it helps calculate planetary masses and distances. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward. Implications for Astronomy Kepler\u2019s Third Law, \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) , connects a planet\u2019s orbit to the mass of the object it orbits (like a star or planet) and the distance between them. This is a big deal because it lets astronomers figure out things about space without needing to visit planets or stars. It\u2019s like a cosmic ruler and scale rolled into one. 1. Calculating Planetary Masses If something (like a moon or satellite) orbits a planet, we can use the law to find the planet\u2019s mass. Here\u2019s how: - Measure the orbital period \\( T \\) (how long one orbit takes) and the radius \\( r \\) (distance from the planet\u2019s center). - Plug those into the equation: \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) . - Rearrange to solve for \\( M \\) (the planet\u2019s mass): \\( M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2} \\) . - Since \\( G \\) is a known constant ( \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) ), and we can observe \\( T \\) and \\( r \\) , we calculate \\( M \\) . For example, Earth\u2019s moon orbits in about 27.3 days ( \\( T \\) ) at a distance of roughly 384,000 km ( \\( r \\) ). Using these, astronomers calculated Earth\u2019s mass long ago. The same trick works for any planet with a moon or for the Sun with planets orbiting it. 2. Measuring Distances If we know the mass of the central body (like the Sun), we can flip the law to find distances: - Measure \\( T \\) (say, a planet\u2019s year). - Use the Sun\u2019s known mass ( \\( M \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) and solve for \\( r \\) : \\( r^3 = \\frac{G M T^2}{4\\pi^2} \\) , then take the cube root. - This gives the average distance from the Sun to the planet. For instance, if we know Mars takes 687 days to orbit the Sun, we can compute its distance from the Sun using the Sun\u2019s mass. This helped map our solar system before telescopes got super precise. 3. Broader Impact Solar System Design : The law shows why inner planets (like Mercury) orbit fast and outer ones (like Neptune) take longer\u2014bigger \\( r \\) means bigger \\( T \\) . Exoplanets : Astronomers spot planets around other stars by watching how long they take to orbit ( \\( T \\) ) and estimating their distance ( \\( r \\) ), then guessing the star\u2019s mass. Satellites : We use it to place satellites at the right distance from Earth for specific orbit times, like 24 hours for GPS satellites. Simple Takeaway Kepler\u2019s Third Law is a tool that turns time and distance into mass and vice versa. Watch how long something orbits and how far it is, and you can weigh a planet or measure its distance from a star. It\u2019s a simple rule that unlocks the scale of the universe! TASK 3 Let\u2019s analyze real-world examples of Kepler\u2019s Third Law ( \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) ) using the Moon\u2019s orbit around Earth and the orbits of planets in the Solar System. I\u2019ll keep it simple and based on the given information about orbital period and radius. 1. The Moon\u2019s Orbit Around Earth The Moon orbits Earth, so Earth\u2019s mass ( \\( M \\) ) is the central mass in the equation. We can use Kepler\u2019s Third Law to check how the Moon\u2019s orbital period and radius fit together. Orbital Period ( \\( T \\) ) : The Moon takes about 27.3 days to orbit Earth. Convert that to seconds for consistency: \\( T = 27.3 \\, \\text{days} \\times 86,400 \\, \\text{s/day} \\approx 2.36 \\times 10^6 \\, \\text{seconds} \\) . Orbital Radius ( \\( r \\) ) : The average distance from Earth to the Moon is about 384,000 km, or \\( r = 3.84 \\times 10^8 \\, \\text{meters} \\) . Earth\u2019s Mass ( \\( M \\) ) : Known to be about \\( 5.972 \\times 10^{24} \\, \\text{kg} \\) . Gravitational Constant ( \\( G \\) ) : \\( 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) . 2. Planets in the Solar System Now let\u2019s look at planets orbiting the Sun, with the Sun\u2019s mass ( \\( M \\approx 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) ) as the central mass. We\u2019ll test Earth and Mars. Simple Solution Kepler\u2019s Third Law works in the real world. For the Moon, its 27.3-day orbit at 384,000 km fits Earth\u2019s mass. For planets like Earth (1 year, 1 AU) and Mars (687 days, 1.524 AU), their orbits match the Sun\u2019s mass. The law ties \\( T^2 \\) to \\( r^3 \\) , letting us predict and check how things move in space. It\u2019s a simple rule that fits the Moon and planets perfectly! TASK 4 Let\u2019s implement a simple computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify Kepler\u2019s Third Law ( \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) ), based on the given information about orbital period and radius. I\u2019ll keep it straightforward, using a basic approach you could code in something like Python, and focus on verifying the relationship. Simple Computational Model We\u2019ll simulate a planet orbiting a star (like the Sun) in a circular orbit. The idea is to calculate the orbital period ( \\( T \\) ) for a given radius ( \\( r \\) ) and mass ( \\( M \\) ), then check if \\( T^2 \\propto r^3 \\) holds. Here\u2019s how to do it simply: Step 1: Set Up the System Central Mass ( \\( M \\) ) : Use the Sun\u2019s mass, \\( M = 1.989 \\times 10^{30} \\, \\text{kg} \\) . Gravitational Constant ( \\( G \\) ) : \\( G = 6.674 \\times 10^{-11} \\, \\text{m}^3 \\text{kg}^{-1} \\text{s}^{-2} \\) . Orbital Radii ( \\( r \\) ) : Pick a few distances, like 1 AU, 2 AU, and 3 AU (1 AU = \\( 1.496 \\times 10^{11} \\, \\text{m} \\) ). Step 2: Calculate Orbital Speed For a circular orbit, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force. The orbital speed ( \\( v \\) ) is: [ v = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} ] We\u2019ll compute this for each radius. Step 3: Compute Orbital Period The period ( \\( T \\) ) is the time to travel the circumference ( \\( 2\\pi r \\) ) at speed \\( v \\) : [ T = \\frac{2\\pi r}{v} = \\frac{2\\pi r}{\\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}}} ] Simplify: [ T = 2\\pi \\sqrt{\\frac{r^3}{G M}} ] This matches Kepler\u2019s Third Law when squared: \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) . Step 5: Conclusion The model calculates \\( T \\) from \\( r \\) and \\( M \\) , and when we square \\( T \\) and compare it to \\( r^3 \\) , the relationship \\( T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3 \\) holds every time. The constant \\( \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} \\) stays the same for the Sun\u2019s mass, proving the law works. Simple Solution This model picks distances (like 1 AU, 2 AU, 3 AU), finds the speed and period using gravity, and checks that \\( T^2 \\) matches \\( r^3 \\) times a constant. For the Sun, 1 AU gives 1 year, 2 AU gives about 2.83 years, and 3 AU gives about 5.2 years\u2014Kepler\u2019s Third Law is spot on every time! Deliverables A detailed explanation of the subjects Orbital Period, Radius, and Kepler\u2019s Third Law Orbital Period The orbital period ( \\( T \\) ) is the time an object takes to complete one full orbit around another body. - Example : Earth orbits the Sun in 1 year (365.25 days), and the Moon orbits Earth in 27.3 days . Orbital Radius The orbital radius ( \\( r \\) ) is the distance between the center of the orbiting object and the body it orbits. - Example : Earth\u2019s orbital radius around the Sun is 1 AU (1.496 \u00d7 10\u00b9\u00b9 m) . Kepler\u2019s Third Law Kepler\u2019s Third Law states: \\[ T^2 \\propto r^3 \\] This means that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the radius . In other words: - Larger orbits take longer \u2014if you double the radius, the period increases by about 2.83 times . - The relationship is based on gravity balancing motion. Why It Matters Kepler\u2019s Law helps us: - Predict planetary motion. - Measure masses of celestial bodies. - Understand why inner planets orbit faster than outer ones.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/2%20Gravity/Problem_1/#task-1","text":"Let\u2019s derive Kepler\u2019s Third Law for circular orbits in a simpler way, focusing on the key ideas with less algebra.

First Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to orbit a celestial body (like Earth) without falling back down. Physical Meaning: This is the speed required to become a satellite. For Earth, it\u2019s about 7.9 km/s (around 28,000 km/h). At this speed, the object moves fast enough that its curved path matches the curve of the planet, keeping it in a stable orbit instead of crashing back due to gravity. Second Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to completely escape a celestial body\u2019s gravitational pull and leave it behind. Physical Meaning: This is the escape velocity. For Earth, it\u2019s about 11.2 km/s (around 40,000 km/h). At this speed, the object has enough energy to break free from the planet\u2019s gravity and head into space, no longer bound to orbit or return. Third Cosmic Velocity: Definition: The minimum speed an object needs to escape the gravitational pull of a star system (like the Sun) and leave it entirely, starting from a planet within that system. Physical Meaning: This is about leaving the solar system. For an object starting from Earth, it\u2019s around 16.6 km/s (relative to Earth) when accounting for Earth\u2019s orbit around the Sun. It means the object overcomes both the planet\u2019s and the star\u2019s gravity to travel into interstellar space. In short: First = orbit the planet. Second = escape the planet. Third = escape the star system. # # TASK2 Analyze the mathematical derivations and parameters affecting these velocities. 1. First Cosmic Velocity (Orbit Speed) What It Is : Speed to circle a planet without falling. Simple Math : \\( v_1 = \\sqrt{\\frac{G M}{r}} \\) \\( G \\) : Gravity constant (a fixed number). \\( M \\) : Planet\u2019s mass. \\( r \\) : Planet\u2019s size (radius). What Changes It : Bigger planet mass ( \\( M \\) ): Faster speed needed. Bigger planet size ( \\( r \\) ): Slower speed needed. Example : Earth \u2192 ~7.9 km/s to orbit. 2. Second Cosmic Velocity (Escape Speed) What It Is : Speed to leave a planet forever. Simple Math : \\( v_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M}{r}} \\) Same \\( G \\) , \\( M \\) , \\( r \\) as above, just doubled under the square root. What Changes It : Bigger mass ( \\( M \\) ): Faster speed. Bigger size ( \\( r \\) ): Slower speed. Link : \\( v_2 = 1.4 \\times v_1 \\) (just \\( \\sqrt{2} \\) times orbit speed). Example : Earth \u2192 ~11.2 km/s to escape. 3. Third Cosmic Velocity (Star Escape Speed) What It Is : Speed to leave the whole star system (e.g., Sun) from a planet. Simple Math (Rough) : \\( v_3 \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{2 G M_{\\text{star}}}{R}} - \\text{orbit speed} + v_2 \\) \\( M_{\\text{star}} \\) : Star\u2019s mass (like the Sun). \\( R \\) : Distance from star to planet. Add planet escape speed ( \\( v_2 \\) ). What Changes It : Bigger star mass ( \\( M_{\\text{star}} \\) ): Faster speed. Farther from star ( \\( R \\) ): Slower speed. Planet\u2019s mass/size: Affects the starting escape. Example : From Earth \u2192 ~16.6 km/s to leave the Solar System. Super Simple Takeaway \\( v_1 \\) : Circle the planet \u2192 depends on planet\u2019s mass and size. \\( v_2 \\) : Leave the planet \u2192 1.4 times \\( v_1 \\) . \\( v_3 \\) : Leave the star \u2192 adds star\u2019s pull and distance. Mass pulls harder (faster speed). Distance spreads pull (slower speed). That\u2019s it! Let me know if this works or if you want it even simpler! # TASK3 Calculate and visualize these velocities for different celestial bodies like Earth, Mars adn Jupyter. Basic Info for Calculations I\u2019ll use approximate values for mass ( \\( M \\) ) and radius ( \\( r \\) ) of each body. For third velocity, I\u2019ll assume escaping the Sun from each planet\u2019s distance ( \\( R \\) ), simplified. No heavy math\u2014just results from plugging in numbers! Earth Mass: \\( 5.97 \\times 10^{24} \\, kg \\) Radius: \\( 6,371 \\, km \\) Distance from Sun: \\( 1 \\, AU \\) (149.6 million km) Mars Mass: \\( 6.42 \\times 10^{23} \\, kg \\) (about 1/10 Earth\u2019s) Radius: \\( 3,390 \\, km \\) (about half Earth\u2019s) Distance from Sun: \\( 1.52 \\, AU \\) (227 million km) Jupiter Mass: \\( 1.90 \\times 10^{27} \\, kg \\) (318 times Earth\u2019s) Radius: \\( 69,911 \\, km \\) (11 times Earth\u2019s) Distance from Sun: \\( 5.2 \\, AU \\) (778 million km) Calculated Velocities (Simple Results) Earth First (Orbit) : ~7.9 km/s Second (Escape) : ~11.2 km/s Third (Sun Escape) : ~16.6 km/s (includes escaping Earth + extra to leave Sun) Mars First (Orbit) : ~3.6 km/s (less mass, smaller size than Earth) Second (Escape) : ~5.0 km/s Third (Sun Escape) : ~14.3 km/s (farther from Sun, less extra speed needed) Jupiter First (Orbit) : ~42.1 km/s (huge mass, big size) Second (Escape) : ~59.5 km/s Third (Sun Escape) : ~18.5 km/s (much farther from Sun, but massive planet escape) Why These Numbers? First : Bigger mass = faster, bigger radius = slower. Jupiter\u2019s huge mass wins. Second : Same deal, just 1.4 times the first. Third : Adds escaping the Sun\u2014closer planets (Earth) need more speed, farther ones (Jupiter) less, but planet escape matters too. Simple Visualization Imagine a bar chart (I can\u2019t draw it here, but I\u2019ll describe it): - X-axis : Three bars for Earth, Mars, Jupiter. - Y-axis : Speed in km/s (0 to 60 km/s). - Bars : - Earth : Three bars\u20147.9 (blue), 11.2 (green), 16.6 (red). - Mars : Three bars\u20143.6 (blue), 5.0 (green), 14.3 (red). - Jupiter : Three bars\u201442.1 (blue), 59.5 (green), 18.5 (red). - Colors : Blue = orbit, Green = escape planet, Red = escape Sun. $$ # Deliverables $$ Cosmic Velocities Simulation This document provides a simple Python script to calculate and visualize the first, second, and third cosmic velocities for Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.
