# Problem 1


 # Theoretical Foundation

Projectile motion starts with two simple ideas: horizontally, a projectile moves at a steady speed because nothing pushes it side-to-side; vertically, gravity pulls it down at a constant rate (9.81 m/s² on Earth). These rules create a curved path, like throwing a ball. The path changes based on:

***Speed:*** Throw faster, it goes farther and higher.

***Angle:*** Low angles favor distance; high angles give height.

***Starting height:*** Throwing from higher up extends the flight.

***Gravity:*** Weaker gravity (like the Moon’s) stretches the path
.
This creates a “family” of paths—each mix of speed, angle, height, or gravity gives a unique curve. For example, a hard throw at 45°
 travels far, while a soft throw straight up lands close. These variations fit many scenarios, from sports to space launches.


# Analysis of the Range

The range (how far the projectile lands) depends heavily on the launch angle:

***Best angle:*** Around 45° usually gives the farthest range on flat ground, balancing height and distance.

***Symmetry:*** Angles like 30° and 60° give the same range, but less than 45°.

***No range:*** Throwing straight up (90°) or flat (0°) means it doesn’t go anywhere horizontally.

### Other factors affect the range too:

***Speed:*** A faster throw (e.g., 20 m/s vs. 10 m/s) sends it much farther.
***Gravity:*** On the Moon (gravity = 1.62 m/s²), the range is way longer than on Earth.
***Starting height:*** Throwing from a height (e.g., 5 m up) adds distance because it stays in the air longer.

For example, a 20 m/s throw at 45° goes farther than a 10 m/s throw, and even farther if launched from a hill or on the Moon.
